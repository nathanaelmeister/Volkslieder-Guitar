# Volkslieder Guitar
## This repository contains a preview of the first Version

the *songname.ly* file will only compile,
if the directory **global-files/** containing the file *score.ily* is present.
for further versions, the *score.ily* could be inserted into the *songname.ly*
to make it possible to download a single compileable *lilypond* file.

no editoral changes are made to *songname.ly* that effect the music itself.
Melody, Chords, Lyrics and Verses remain untouched.

**Removed from the *songname.ly* are:**
* multible blank lines
* comments at the end of lines
* obsolete lines

**Changes made to the *songname.ily*:**
* ported to 2.18.2 with *convert-ly*
* reformatted and reinindented
* added credits for Guitar-Version
